## Curriculum Name

Higher University Course in Robot Programming with ROS

## Information

### Basic Information

#### Presentation:

ROS (Robot Operating System) is the current standard in the area of ​​Robotics. So much so that it is essential in research in this area, and an essential requirement to access any job position related to Robotics. The learning process in ROS using the resources available on the web has a very high learning curve in the first months, so adequate training is required to guide you in this process. This course aims to respond to this demand, with an approach that combines theoretical explanations with practical exercises with real and simulated robots.

Our Robotics group is a pioneer in this technology in Spain, collaborating with this software, and being included as advisers in several European projects as experts in this technology.

#### Targets:

This course provides an introduction to this robots programming environment, covering all the necessary concepts and topics to carry out complex projects with robots

The course targets are:

* That the student is able, at the end of the course, to tackle a project using ROS, be aware of the tools, procedures and good practices in this technology.

* That the student gets a general vision of the problems that exist in the Mobile Robotics and the solutions proposed by ROS.

### Program (Studying Plan)

* **General Concepts About ROS:** This section will approach the main concepts of ROS: History and evolution, ROS Community, Documentation, use of the workspace, Source code analysis, compilation and execution of ROS nodes, basic commands, debugging, modeling of sensors and actuators, computational graph and the geometric transformation system.

* **Perception with ROS:** Access to the sensors (camera, 3D-RGBD camera, laser, etc) and their usage with the OpenCV and PCL reference libraries. Basic behaviors creation for a mobile robot using this information source.

* **Navigation with ROS:** Configuring, mapping and start up of the navigation system with ROS in a mobile robot.

* **ROS Complements:** ROS in Arduino and Raspberry. Introduction to the manipulation with ROS. Tools and code editors for the developer.

### Course Receivers

An Engineer degree is required. If you do not have this training, you can provide professional experience in the field of Engineering. Programming knowledge in Python / C ++ environment and Linux. In the event that the number of applications exceeds the number of places offered, a selection will be made based on the following criteria: **Personal interview**.

* **Number of Places:** 12.

### Academic Direction and Faculty

* **Director and main professor of the course:** Dr. Francisco Martín Rico.
